# Project Plan

**Author**: Group 5

## 1. Introduction

The product we are delivering is a reminders app, that will allow the user to create, edit, and delete reminders, and reminders lists.

## 2. Process Description

**Inception** 
- This is the beginning of the app. The objective here is to establish the app/program’s goals and what are its limitations. It also includes market research, cost analysis, and risk assessment.
- To begin we have to find the use for our program, what is needed to achieve our goals, what can/cannot be achieved with our program, and what are the expectations of the stakeholders.
- Before moving out of inception, we must make sure all shareholders are in agreement with the goals of the program, and we have looked at and assessed all possible risks.

**Elaboration**
- After approval, the team will dive even deeper to make sure there is nothing that can stop the program from continuing. 
- To begin with elaboration, we must first have the approval of the stakeholders.
- If no problems have come up during our research of the project, then we can continue on to the next phase.

**Construction**
- Activity description: Perform the coding work, building the software and integrating components. Make sure the system meets design requirements.
- Entrance criteria : A validated system architecture from the elaboration.
- Exit criteria: An almost complete system, all the features have been developed, and tested. Make sure the software is ready for testing.


**Transition**
- This is where the team is transitioning from the development portion of the project, to the production portion. This is where the testing will be held in the form of QA and perhaps a beta.
- All problems in the program have been solved,and is ready for testing. 
- The program has been tested for all use cases, all problems have been addressed, and is now ready to be used by the public.
