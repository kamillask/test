# Test Plan
**Author**: Group 5

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Our testing strategy for the Reminder App will be focused on manual testing, covering different aspects of the application's functionality. The testing levels will include:

**Manual Testing:** Testers will manually interact with the application's user interface and features to ensure correct behavior.

The testing will be carried out iteratively, with each release cycle going through manual testing to validate the functionality.

### 1.2 Test Selection

The selection of test cases will be based on both black-box and white-box testing techniques:
* Black-box Testing: Test cases will be derived from the software requirements and specifications without considering the internal workings of the application. This will include:

    * Functional Testing: To verify that each function of the software application behaves as specified in the sequence behavioral description.

    * Non-functional Testing: To assess the application’s performance, usability, reliability, and responsiveness.

* White-box Testing: Test cases will be based on the internal structure of the application. This will include:

    * Path Testing: To ensure all possible paths through the code are executed at least once.

    * Statement and Branch Coverage: To ensure that all possible branches in the code have been tested and that every statement in the code has been executed.

Both techniques will be employed at different testing levels. For example, unit testing will lean more towards white-box testing, while system testing will primarily utilize black-box testing.

Then we will proceed to define specific test cases based on the features and behaviors described.


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

**Code Coverage:** Aiming for at least 80% code coverage for unit tests.

**Requirements:** Coverage; make sure all the functional requirements are covered by one test case for system testing.


### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bug tracking was recorded in our UserManual.md. Whenever we ran into something that did not work, we would add it to that document, and address it.

### 1.5 Technology

We did not use any external programs to conduct out testing. Testing was done manually by creating test cases, and seeing if the program worked with them or not.
