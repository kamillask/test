# RemindersApp User Manual

This user manual will help you get familiar with how to use the RemindersApp, as well as showing you the UI and some common issues/bugs that you may run into.




## 1. Introduction

This app allows the user to create reminder lists, and add reminders to them. They can further organize their reminders by giving the reminder a type. We also allow the user to check off reminders when complete without deleting them, unchecking all reminders with one click, and delete reminders.
## 2. System Requirements

The user must be using an Android device that supports an SDK level of at least 28 (Android 9).
## 3. Installation

- Go to the settings for your device, scroll down to Apps, press the 3 dots, select "Special Access", select Chrome(if you are downloading the APK from there), select "Install unknown apps", and check on "Allow from this source".
- Install the app from our GitHub page.
- Go to your device's file manager, select the RemindersApp APK, and follow the steps to install.[^1]

[^1]: Installation step credits: https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185. Instruction steps might be slightly different for the Android version that you are using.
## 4. Getting Started

After installing the app, the user can open the app from their app library. Upon opening, you will see the home page of the app. It will be empty, so to begin, click on the plus icon on the bottom left of the screen to add a Reminder List. 

You can now go back to the home page, where you will see your newly created Reminder List. To add a reminder to this list, click on the Reminder List. This will again be empty, so you must click the plus icon on the bottom left to add a reminder.

After clicking the plus, you will see a page with a drop down menu, a field to create a new Reminder Type, a field for the Reminder Name, and a toggle to choose if you want your reminder to be given a time, and a field to set that time. The drop down menu allows your to select a Reminder Type that you have already created, and if you want to create a new type, you can simply enter it in the Reminder Type field, and when you create the reminder with that type, it will also save that type for use for future reminders.

If you have completed a reminder, you have the option of checking it off by clicking the box on the left hand of the reminder. You can clear it by clicking the box again. If you have many reminders that you want to clear checks off of, you can click the button on the bottom right to clear them. If you want to completely get rid of the reminder, you can click the three dots to the right of the reminder, and select the delete option.
