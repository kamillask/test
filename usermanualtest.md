## 1. Introduction

Our app allows the user to store their reminders, grouped by a reminder list. They can further sort their reminders by labelling it with a reminder type.
## 2. System Requirements

The user must be using an Android device that supports an SDK level of at least 28 (Android 9).
## 3. Installation

- Go to the settings for your device, scroll down to Apps, press the 3 dots, select "Special Access", select Chrome(if you are downloading the APK from there), select "Install unknown apps", and check on "Allow from this source".
- Install the app from our GitHub page.
- Go to your device's file manager, select the RemindersApp APK, and follow the steps to install.[^1]

[^1]: Installation step credits: https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185. Instruction steps might be slightly different for the Android version that you are using.
  
## 4. Getting Started

After installing the app, the user can open the app from their app library. Upon opening, you will see the home page of the app. It will be empty, so to begin, click on the plus icon on the bottom left of the screen to add a Reminder List. 

You can now go back to the home page, where you will see your newly created Reminder List. To add a reminder to this list, click on the Reminder List. This will again be empty, so you must click the plus icon on the bottom left to add a reminder.

After clicking the plus, you will see a page with a drop down menu, a field to create a new Reminder Type, a field for the Reminder Name, and a toggle to choose if you want your reminder to be given a time, and a field to set that time. The drop down menu allows your to select a Reminder Type that you have already created, and if you want to create a new type, you can simply enter it in the Reminder Type field, and when you create the reminder with that type, it will also save that type for use for future reminders.
